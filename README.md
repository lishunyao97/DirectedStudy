## Automatic Entity-based Distractor Generation

SmartReader System requires a time-efficient, high quality distractor generator to test readersâ€™ understanding about English passages. This project proposed a novel way to generate entity-based distractors based on fine-grained question classification and BERT embeddings. The automatic entity-based distractor generation system can be initialized in 10 seconds and the averaging time consumed to generate three distractors for a question-answer pair is 2.3s. The system also beats baseline model on overall, grammar and semantics score in human evaluation.
